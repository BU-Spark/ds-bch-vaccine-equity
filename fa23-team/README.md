Update this README with information on how to run your project. 

To start with the project, please use data_explore_vac.ipynb. In this file, we have data cleaning and exploration of the MA vaccine data for generating graphs of race groups. Since other factors like gender and age are included in the same data file as race. The data format in this file is the same. You can change to different sheet and then explore factors other than race groups. 

To start with merging all of the data together, please use data_analysis_vac.ipynb. In this file, we merge all of the factors together in one file and then conduct feature importance analysis and regression analysis for each factors. 

If there are some other parts that are interested to you, please kindly refer to other teammates' work.
